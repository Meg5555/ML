    <h1> Dear mauwie, </h1>
    <div>
    <p> Since you dont know how to write a love letter I might as well do it to make you happy . 
        <br>
        I love you and hate seeing you frustrated , so I thought i might as well make you a little happier.
        <br>
        Besides the fact that I am practicing my skills , I might as  well butter up to you.
        <br>
        I know our fights are rough but our highs are amazing and I am a 100% sure that I want  to spend my lows and highs with you.
        <br>
        You  are difficult to work with and communicate with at times, but I want to work these out with you , so a little patience on your side will be delightful.
        <br>
        I want to actually spend my life with you and hence I want to work with you , I love you more than words can express, it may not be prevelant at times but it is the truth.
        <br>
        You mean the world to me. I love you Prachet.
        <br>
        You are my idiot and will remain my idiot , there is no way I am letting you goor reconsier us , because unfortunately for you you're stuck with me now forever.
        <br>
        XOXO
